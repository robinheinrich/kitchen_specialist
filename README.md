### Work in progress!!!

### Addon for HomeAssistant and standalone version

Installation through HACS with updates when Repo is added or install it manually without update notifications.

You can import it as an Addon in HomeAssistant via HACS by adding this repo and use it inside HA or under the <HA-IP>:8000
Data is the same on both ends.

### Issues and bugs
- Currently only in German.
- Recipes are not working atm
